# PointVortex analysis notebook

`point_vortex_analysis.ipynb` reads a trajectory CSV and diagnostics CSV produced by any solver
backend. It writes two vector PDF figures:

- `diagnostics_evolution.pdf` shows the Hamiltonian, geometry-relevant impulses, conservation
  drift, and cumulative dipole events;
- `vortex_configurations.pdf` shows evenly spaced physical-space snapshots, including the
  periodic square or disk boundary when applicable.

Launch Jupyter from the repository root:

```bash
jupyter lab scripts/analysis/point_vortex_analysis.ipynb
```

Edit the settings in the first code cell to select `infinite`, `periodic`, or `disk`, specify the
domain size, input CSV paths, number of snapshots, and output directory. The defaults read
`runs/default/trajectory.csv` and `runs/default/diagnostics.csv` and write PDFs under
`runs/default/figures/`.

The notebook requires Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter. It does not require pandas or a
LaTeX installation. It searches upward for the repository root, so it can also be launched from
the notebook directory.

The two files may have different output intervals. Each plot uses the corresponding file's time
column. If the trajectory has no rows because all vortices were removed before the first output,
the notebook still writes diagnostics and skips the configuration figure with a message.
Configurations otherwise use only saved frames with surviving vortices.
